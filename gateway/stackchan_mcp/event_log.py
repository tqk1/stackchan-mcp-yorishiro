"""Event log writer for firmware-originated stackchan events.

When the JSONL notification path is enabled, the gateway appends each
successfully-validated ``stackchan-event`` frame to a JSONL file (default
``~/.claude/stackchan-events.jsonl``) so downstream host integrations can
read events between the firmware reaction and the next conversational
turn. MCP notification paths are configured independently.

The log file path is overridable via ``STACKCHAN_EVENTS_PATH`` or an
explicit caller-provided path. Entries
whose ``ts_unix`` is older than ``RETENTION_DAYS`` are pruned exactly
once on gateway startup via :func:`rotate_old_entries`. Long-running
gateways are not re-rotated mid-flight; downstream readers are expected
to filter by ``ts_unix`` themselves, and any disk-growth concern over
multi-day uptimes is tracked as a separate follow-up.

All persistence failures (``PermissionError``, ``OSError``, malformed
lines, missing parent directory, etc.) are caught and logged at WARNING
level. The MCP notification path must never be broken by event log
persistence issues; callers should treat this helper as fire-and-forget.

        Optional human-axis avatar action to include in the JSONL payload.
    path
        Optional resolved log path from notify.yml. When omitted, the legacy

    ts_unix
        Optional override for the wall-clock timestamp. Defaults to
