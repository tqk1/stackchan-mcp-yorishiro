"""Event log writer for firmware-originated stackchan events.

The gateway appends each successfully-validated ``stackchan-event`` frame
to a JSONL file (default ``~/.claude/stackchan-events.jsonl``) so that
downstream consumers — most notably an MCP client hook that injects the
event into the next agent turn as additional context — can read events
between the firmware reaction and the next conversational turn. This is
the gateway-side half of the "touch event reaches the LLM client" path;
the MCP notification path itself remains unchanged and is the primary
delivery channel for capability-aware clients.

The log file path is overridable via ``STACKCHAN_EVENTS_PATH``. Entries
whose ``ts_unix`` is older than ``RETENTION_DAYS`` are pruned exactly
once on gateway startup via :func:`rotate_old_entries`. Long-running
gateways are not re-rotated mid-flight; downstream readers are expected
to filter by ``ts_unix`` themselves, and any disk-growth concern over
multi-day uptimes is tracked as a separate follow-up.

All persistence failures (``PermissionError``, ``OSError``, malformed
lines, missing parent directory, etc.) are caught and logged at WARNING
level. The MCP notification path must never be broken by event log
persistence issues; callers should treat this helper as fire-and-forget.
