"""TTS engine abstraction.

Each concrete engine produces 16 kHz mono PCM bytes from input text.
Opus encoding for transmission to the device, and the WebSocket push,
are handled by :mod:`stackchan_mcp.tts.orchestrator` so engines stay
focused on synthesis.

This module is intentionally dependency-free: it must import cleanly
without ``httpx`` / ``opuslib`` / ``torch`` so that callers can introspect
the registered engines (e.g. for ``get_status``) even when the optional
``[tts]`` / ``[tts-irodori]`` extras are not installed.
