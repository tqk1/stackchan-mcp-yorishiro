"""faster-whisper engine — local STT with no cloud round-trip.

faster-whisper is a CTranslate2 reimplementation of OpenAI Whisper that
runs well on CPU and is the default engine for this gateway (see
Issue #91). The library is MIT-licensed and the bundled models are
downloaded on first use from the Hugging Face Hub.

By default the ``base`` multilingual model is loaded — small enough to
fit on a developer Mac without GPU and accurate enough for short
Japanese utterances. Override per-call via the ``model`` argument of
the ``listen`` MCP tool, or globally via the ``STACKCHAN_FASTER_WHISPER_MODEL``
environment variable.

# :meth:`FasterWhisperEngine._load_model`), and a ``listen()`` call
# would put the device into recording mode + wait for the entire
# capture window before failing at decode time — surfacing a stale
# "install [stt-faster-whisper]" error to the agent only after the
