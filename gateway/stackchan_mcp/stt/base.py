"""STT engine abstraction.

Each concrete engine takes 16 kHz mono PCM (signed 16-bit LE) and
returns a transcription. Opus decoding from the device wire format and
PCM buffering are handled by :mod:`stackchan_mcp.stt.orchestrator` so
engines stay focused on recognition.

This module is intentionally dependency-free: it must import cleanly
without ``faster-whisper`` / ``openai`` / ``opuslib`` so that callers
can introspect the registered engines even when the optional ``[stt]``
extras are not installed. Mirrors :mod:`stackchan_mcp.tts.base`.
