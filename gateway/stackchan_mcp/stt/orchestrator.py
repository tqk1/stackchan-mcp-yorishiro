"""STT orchestration: drive listening, collect frames, decode, transcribe.

The orchestrator is the glue between the ``listen`` MCP tool (defined
in :mod:`stackchan_mcp.stdio_server`) and the STT engine implementations
registered in :mod:`stackchan_mcp.stt`. For each call it:

1. Validates arguments.
2. Looks up the requested engine.
3. Acquires the device's listen lock so two concurrent ``listen()``
   invocations cannot overlap (they would otherwise both buffer
   inbound Opus frames into the same capture and produce a mixed
   transcription).
4. Switches the audio_stream module into recording mode so binary
   frames stop being discarded and start being buffered.
5. Sends ``{"type":"listen","state":"start","mode":"manual"}`` to put
   the device firmware into listening state and stream microphone
   Opus frames up the existing WebSocket.
6. Waits ``duration_ms`` (the capture window).
7. Sends ``{"type":"listen","state":"stop"}`` to drop the device back
   to idle and stop the inbound frame stream.
8. Decodes the buffered Opus frames into 16 kHz mono PCM and hands
   the blob off to the engine for transcription.
9. Returns ``{ text, duration_ms, language, frame_count }`` to the
   MCP client.

Symmetric to :mod:`stackchan_mcp.tts.orchestrator` — same error-class
discipline (``ValueError`` for bad arguments, ``NotImplementedError``
for missing engine, ``RuntimeError`` for runtime failures) and the
same protocol-v1 gate.
