# stackchan-mcp

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) bridge for the **M5Stack official [StackChan](https://docs.m5stack.com/ja/StackChan)** (2025 Kickstarter shipping kit), letting any LLM client drive the device.

> Born out of the [stack-chan project](https://github.com/stack-chan/stack-chan) community (originated by Shinya Ishikawa in 2021). This repository targets the M5Stack official StackChan kit that grew out of that lineage.

## Tools (callable by MCP clients via the gateway)

| Tool | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `get_status` | Gateway connection state | ✅ |
| `get_device_info` | ESP32 device state (battery / volume / WiFi / etc.) | ✅ |
| `take_photo(question?)` | Capture a frame, save as JPEG, return the path | ✅ |
| `set_volume(volume)` | Speaker volume (0-100) | ✅ |

| `set_leds(colors)` | Batch-set the first N LEDs from a `[[r,g,b], ...]` array in a single I2C burst (use this for animations / multi-color patterns); trailing LEDs keep their previous color | ✅ |
| `clear_leds` | Turn all 12 base RGB LEDs off | ✅ |
| `say(text, voice?, speaker_id?, reference_audio?)` | Speak text on the device speaker via gateway-side TTS. Default engine: **VOICEVOX** (runs as a separate HTTP service — see [TTS setup](#optional-tts-setup-voicevox)). Requires the `[tts]` extra. | ✅ |
| `listen(duration_ms?, engine?, language?, model?, motion?, look_up_pitch?)` | Capture a short utterance from the device microphone and transcribe it via gateway-side STT. Default engine: **faster-whisper** (local, MIT) — see [STT setup](#optional-stt-setup-faster-whisper). Optional `motion` feedback can show the `thinking` face or tilt the head up during capture. Requires the `[stt-faster-whisper]` (or `[stt-openai]`) extra and a firmware update with the inbound `listen` wire type. | ✅ |

See `gateway/README.md` for full schemas.

## Quick start

### 1. Flash the firmware (CoreS3)

There are two paths. **Option A** is recommended for first-time users — no toolchain setup needed. **Option B** is for contributors who want to build from source.

#### Option A: Flash a pre-built binary (recommended for end users)

Download the latest firmware bundle from the [Releases page](https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/stackchan-mcp/releases) — pick the most recent `firmware-v*` release and grab `merged-binary.bin` (and optionally `xiaozhi.bin`). Then flash with `esptool.py`:

```bash
# Replace --port with your platform's serial device:
#   macOS:   /dev/cu.usbmodem* (e.g. /dev/cu.usbmodem1101)
#   Linux:   /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyACM0
#   Windows: COM3 (or whichever it shows up as in Device Manager)

# Clean install (resets NVS — Wi-Fi settings will need to be re-entered):
esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port /dev/cu.usbmodem1101 -b 460800 \
  write_flash 0x0 merged-binary.bin

# Or, app-only update (preserves NVS — keeps your Wi-Fi setup):
esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port /dev/cu.usbmodem1101 -b 460800 \
  write_flash 0x20000 xiaozhi.bin
```

No ESP-IDF or Docker setup needed.

#### Option B: Build from source with Docker (for contributors)

This repository uses git submodules under `firmware/components/`. If you
cloned without `--recursive`, initialize them first:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then build:

```bash
cd firmware
docker run --rm --cpus=4 --ulimit nofile=65536:65536 \
  -v $PWD:/project -w /project espressif/idf:v5.5.2 \
  python ./scripts/release.py stackchan
# → releases/v2.2.6_stackchan.zip

# Flash (after USB-connecting the CoreS3).
# Replace --port with your platform's serial device — see the Option A
# note above for the macOS/Linux/Windows mapping.
esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port /dev/cu.usbmodem1101 -b 460800 \
  write_flash 0x0 build/merged-binary.bin
```

The `--cpus=4` flag caps Docker container parallelism so the concurrent
LVGL / `xiaozhi-fonts/emoji_*.c` compile steps stay within the memory
budget on macOS Docker hosts (OrbStack / Docker Desktop). Without it,
`ninja` autodetects job count from `/proc/cpuinfo` and the resulting
parallel `gcc` pressure can exhaust container memory mid-LVGL with
`Cannot allocate memory` — even on hosts with ample physical RAM
(tracked as #112). The `--ulimit nofile=65536:65536` flag separately
avoids a `Too many open files` failure during the same LVGL compile
step under the default file-descriptor limit. Linux hosts with higher
defaults are unaffected, but passing both flags unconditionally is
safe and matches CI.

After flashing, WiFi configuration happens on first boot — connect from a smartphone to the setup UI (the xiaozhi-esp32 standard flow).

On a local network, the gateway advertises `_stackchan-mcp._tcp.local.`
by default. Fresh firmware can use that mDNS/DNS-SD record to find the
WebSocket endpoint automatically when no primary URL has been saved yet.

### Configuring the WebSocket gateway URL and auth token

Primary URL resolution order:

1. NVS `websocket.url`
2. mDNS `_stackchan-mcp._tcp.local.` when `CONFIG_STACKCHAN_MDNS_DISCOVERY`
   is enabled and the primary NVS URL is empty
3. `CONFIG_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_URL`
4. Empty/fail with a boot log error

Existing `websocket.fallback_url` and
`CONFIG_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_FALLBACK_URL` candidates are still tried after the
primary candidate path above. `CONFIG_FORCE_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_URL=y` remains
an explicit exception for stale-NVS recovery: a non-empty Kconfig URL wins and
mDNS discovery is skipped.

The gateway advertises mDNS by default; run `stackchan-mcp --no-mdns` to
disable advertisement. To compile out firmware discovery, set
`CONFIG_STACKCHAN_MDNS_DISCOVERY=n`. Discovery requires UDP multicast on the
local LAN, and some routers or VLANs block it. When multiple gateways are
visible, the firmware picks the first supported gateway service, tries each
usable IPv4 address from that service, and logs the selected instance, host,
address list, and port. mDNS only discovers the URL;
`websocket.token` / `CONFIG_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_TOKEN` still control
authentication.

The firmware reads these NVS keys for the gateway connection:

- `websocket.url` — the gateway WebSocket URL (e.g. `ws://192.168.1.100:8765/`)
- `websocket.fallback_url` — optional second gateway URL to try when
  `websocket.url` cannot be reached or does not complete the server hello flow
- `websocket.token` — the bearer token sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`,
  matched against `STACKCHAN_TOKEN` / `BEARER_TOKEN` on the gateway side
  (leave both empty to skip authentication entirely)

There are three practical ways to provide them:

1. **Build-time defaults via Kconfig (recommended for developers)**: run
   `idf.py menuconfig` → `Component config` → `Xiaozhi Assistant`, and set:
   - `Default WebSocket gateway URL (fallback when NVS is empty)` →
     `CONFIG_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_URL` (e.g. `ws://192.168.1.100:8765/`)
   - `Fallback WebSocket gateway URL` →
     `CONFIG_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_FALLBACK_URL`
   - `Default WebSocket auth token (fallback when NVS is empty)` →
     `CONFIG_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_TOKEN` (leave empty if your gateway accepts
     unauthenticated connections)

   By default these only apply when the corresponding NVS key is empty.
   For first-time flashes onto a fresh device this is exactly what you want.
   If both a primary and fallback URL are configured, the firmware tries them
   in deterministic order and keeps the first candidate that completes the
   WebSocket server hello flow.

2. **Use the on-device WiFi config UI (recommended for fresh users)**: while
   the device is in WiFi configuration mode, open the captive portal at
   `http://192.168.4.1`, switch to the **Advanced** tab, and fill in:
   - **WebSocket Gateway URL** (e.g. `ws://<gateway-host>:8765/`) — the
     primary gateway candidate.
   - **Fallback Gateway URL** (e.g. `wss://<node>.<tailnet>.ts.net/`) —
     optional second candidate, tried only after the primary candidate
     fails the server-hello flow.
   - **Gateway Token** — optional bearer token, sent as
     `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to both candidates when set. The
     current value is never displayed (the WiFi config AP is
     unauthenticated, so the GET endpoint reports only whether a token
     is configured). Leave the field blank to keep the existing token,
     type a new value to update it, or hit ❌ to fall back to the
     build-time `CONFIG_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_TOKEN`. On stock builds where
     no Kconfig default is set this disables auth; on builds that ship
     a default token, ❌ reverts to that default rather than truly
     clearing authentication. To switch the device to an unauthenticated
     gateway on a build that ships a default token, rebuild the
     firmware with the Kconfig default empty (or set a non-empty token
     on the gateway side that matches the build default).

   Submit to persist the values to the `websocket` NVS namespace
   (`websocket.url` / `websocket.fallback_url` / `websocket.token`); they
   are read on the next boot. This is the intended path for end users
   running a pre-built firmware. Clearing a URL field with the ❌ button
   and submitting again falls back to the matching
   `CONFIG_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_*` Kconfig value (or to "no fallback" when
   no Kconfig default is set).

3. **Write `websocket.url` / `websocket.fallback_url` / `websocket.token`
   directly to NVS** (advanced): for example with a custom NVS-write tool
   over serial. Same persistence semantics as the WiFi config UI;
   primarily useful for batch provisioning.

4. **Temporary source hardcode (not recommended)**: editing
   `websocket_protocol.cc` can unblock local experiments, but keep it out of
   commits.

Common gateway URL setups:

| Mode | Primary URL | Fallback URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local only | `ws://<gateway-host>:8765/` | empty |
| Tailscale only | `wss://<node>.<tailnet>.ts.net/` | empty |
| Local with remote fallback | `ws://<gateway-host>:8765/` | `wss://<node>.<tailnet>.ts.net/` |

#### Existing devices with stale NVS — `CONFIG_FORCE_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_URL`

If you are flashing onto a device that previously ran upstream xiaozhi-esp32
firmware, NVS will already contain `websocket.url=wss://api.tenclass.net/...`
written by the upstream OTA-config path. In this case the empty-NVS fallback
in option 1 above will **not** trigger, and the device will keep trying to
talk to tenclass instead of your local gateway. There is currently no
runtime tool to clear the `websocket` NVS namespace selectively.

To work around this without erasing all of NVS (which would also drop WiFi
credentials), enable the force-override switch:

- `Force CONFIG_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_URL/TOKEN to override NVS` →
  `CONFIG_FORCE_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_URL=y`

When set, **non-empty** Kconfig URL/token values override whatever NVS holds.
Empty Kconfig values still fall through to the NVS-based behaviour, so leaving
the token Kconfig empty keeps any NVS-stored token in use. The boot log will
show `FORCE: overriding NVS websocket.url with Kconfig: NVS=... -> ...` so you
can verify the override fired. This switch is the recommended way to bring
ex-xiaozhi hardware onto a local stackchan-mcp gateway, and to lock CI/dev
images to a known gateway URL.

The switch is opt-in so end-user devices configured at runtime keep their
NVS-priority semantics.

#### Developer-local overrides — `sdkconfig.defaults.local`

For local hardware testing, do not put personal gateway URLs or tokens in the
tracked `firmware/sdkconfig.defaults`. Instead, create a gitignored local file:

```bash
cd firmware
cat > sdkconfig.defaults.local <<'EOF'
CONFIG_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_URL="ws://<your-lan-ip>:8765/"
CONFIG_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_FALLBACK_URL="wss://<node>.<tailnet>.ts.net/"
CONFIG_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_TOKEN="<your-dev-token>"
CONFIG_FORCE_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_URL=y
EOF
```

Both `python ./scripts/release.py <board>` and plain `idf.py build` will read
this file when it exists. The file is ignored by git, so personal settings
cannot be added accidentally with `git add -A`.

### 2. Start the gateway

The gateway can either be installed as the published PyPI package
(recommended for end users) or run from this repository as a checkout
(recommended for contributors who want to follow `main`).

#### Option A: install as a tool (recommended for end users)

For an isolated install that does not collide with your system Python or
other Python projects, use one of:

```bash
uv tool install stackchan-mcp
# or
pipx install stackchan-mcp
```

Then run the gateway:

```bash
stackchan-mcp
```

If you prefer a project-managed virtualenv, `pip install stackchan-mcp`
inside an active venv works as well, and `python -m stackchan_mcp`
inside that venv is equivalent to `stackchan-mcp`. Just avoid
`pip install` against the system Python (PEP 668).

The `STACKCHAN_TOKEN`, `VISION_HOST`, and other settings documented in
[`gateway/README.md`](gateway/README.md#setup) can be supplied via environment
variables, the active shell, or a `.env` file in the working directory.

#### Option B: from source via uv (contributors)

```bash
cd gateway
cp .env.example .env       # set STACKCHAN_TOKEN / VISION_HOST
uv sync
uv run python -m stackchan_mcp
```

If the gateway is restarted while the ESP32 is already connected, the firmware
automatically retries the WebSocket connection while idle. The retry delay starts
at 5 seconds and backs off up to 60 seconds; use `get_status` to confirm that
the device has reappeared. The same retry path also fires for any
post-handshake server-initiated close — gateway crashes, TLS-layer resets, and
gateway configurations that tear the WebSocket session down after the handshake
— so the device recovers automatically once the gateway accepts the next
connection attempt.

For non-LAN setups, see [`docs/remote-access.md`](docs/remote-access.md) for the
Tailscale Funnel flow and the `VISION_URL` capture callback setting.

### 3. Register as an MCP client (Claude Code example)

Add to `~/.claude.json`.

If you installed via `pip install stackchan-mcp`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stackchan-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "stackchan-mcp",
      "env": {
        "STACKCHAN_TOKEN": "your-secret-token-here",
        "VISION_HOST": "your.host.lan.ip"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you installed from source via `uv`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stackchan-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run", "--directory", "/path/to/stackchan-mcp/gateway",
        "python", "-m", "stackchan_mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

See `gateway/README.md` for details.

### 4. Optional: TTS setup (VOICEVOX)

To make the device speak, install the `[tts]` extra and run a
[VOICEVOX](https://voicevox.hiroshiba.jp/) engine alongside the
gateway. VOICEVOX runs as a separate HTTP service, so its LGPL-3.0
license stays scoped to that process — the MIT-licensed gateway only
issues HTTP requests against it.

#### Run the engine (Docker)

```bash
docker run --rm -p '127.0.0.1:50021:50021' \
  voicevox/voicevox_engine:cpu-ubuntu20.04-latest
```

The engine listens on port 50021 by default. The CPU image is fine
for short sentences; GPU images are also published upstream.

#### Install the TTS extra

```bash
pip install 'stackchan-mcp[tts]'
# or, equivalently:
pip install 'stackchan-mcp[tts-voicevox]'
```

This pulls in `httpx` (HTTP client) and `opuslib` (Opus encoder
bindings). The encoder needs `libopus` on the system —
`brew install opus` on macOS, `sudo apt-get install libopus0` on
Debian/Ubuntu.

#### Configure (optional)

| Environment variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `STACKCHAN_VOICEVOX_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:50021` | VOICEVOX engine URL. |
| `STACKCHAN_VOICEVOX_DEFAULT_SPEAKER` | `3` | Default speaker ID (Zundamon normal). See the [VOICEVOX speaker list](https://github.com/VOICEVOX/voicevox_engine) for other options. |

#### Try it

From an MCP client:

```
say(text="こんにちは、わたしはスタックチャンです")
```

The gateway POSTs to VOICEVOX, decodes the returned WAV, resamples to
16 kHz mono, encodes Opus frames (60 ms each), and pushes them as
WebSocket binary frames to the device — which decodes and plays them
through its speaker. **No firmware changes are required**: the
existing audio decoder pipeline already accepts these frames. The
TTS framework is engine-agnostic, so additional engines (Irodori-TTS
voice cloning is on the roadmap) can be added without changing the
`say` API.

### 5. Optional: STT setup (faster-whisper)

To let the device hear, install one of the `[stt-*]` extras and pair
it with a firmware that supports the inbound `listen` wire type
(present from this release onward). The gateway sends a `listen.start`
notification, the firmware opens the microphone, and the inbound
Opus frames are decoded and transcribed locally — no audio leaves
your machine when you use the default `faster-whisper` engine.

#### Install the STT extra

For local transcription with [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper)
(MIT-licensed, CTranslate2-based, runs on CPU):

```bash
pip install 'stackchan-mcp[stt-faster-whisper]'
```

For the [OpenAI Whisper API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text)
(cloud, useful when local compute is constrained):

```bash
pip install 'stackchan-mcp[stt-openai]'
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Both extras include the base `[stt]` extra which pulls in `opuslib`
for decoding the inbound frames. The decoder needs the system
`libopus` library — `brew install opus` on macOS,
`sudo apt-get install libopus0` on Debian/Ubuntu (this is the same
prerequisite as the `[tts]` extra).

#### Configure (optional)

| Environment variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `STACKCHAN_FASTER_WHISPER_MODEL` | `base` | Model identifier — `tiny` / `base` / `small` / `medium` / `large-v3`. Larger models are more accurate but slower and use more memory. |
| `STACKCHAN_FASTER_WHISPER_DEVICE` | `cpu` | `cpu` / `cuda` / `auto`. |
| `STACKCHAN_FASTER_WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE` | `int8` | `int8` / `float16` / `float32`. |
| `STACKCHAN_OPENAI_WHISPER_MODEL` | `whisper-1` | OpenAI Whisper model identifier (only `whisper-1` is currently exposed by the API). |

#### Try it

From an MCP client:

```
listen(duration_ms=5000, language="ja")
```

The gateway sends `{"type":"listen","state":"start","mode":"manual"}`
to the device, buffers the Opus frames the device streams up for the
capture window, then sends `{"type":"listen","state":"stop"}` and
hands the buffered audio to the registered STT engine. The first call
to the `faster-whisper` engine downloads the chosen model (~140 MB
for `base`) into the Hugging Face cache; subsequent calls reuse it.
For visible capture feedback, pass `motion="face-only"` to show the
`thinking` avatar during capture and restore `idle` at the end, or
`motion="look-up"` to preserve yaw, tilt pitch to `look_up_pitch`
(default 50°, valid 5..85°), show `thinking`, and hold that pose on
success. The STT framework is engine-agnostic — additional engines
(Vosk, whisper.cpp, cloud providers) can be added without changing
the `listen` API.

### 6. Optional: enable event notifications

Stack-chan physical events (touch tap / stroke) can be delivered through
several notification paths, depending on host capabilities. All paths are
disabled by default; opt in via `~/.config/stackchan-mcp/notify.yml`. The
Channels mechanism uses an experimental MCP capability and may evolve.

To enable Channels notifications:

1. Gateway side — turn Channels on in `~/.config/stackchan-mcp/notify.yml`:

   ```yaml
   channels:
     enabled: true
   ```

2. Plugin installation — install this repository as a Claude Code plugin
   from the `kisaragi-mochi-channels` marketplace:

   ```bash
   claude plugin install stackchanmcp@kisaragi-mochi-channels
   ```

   For local development against your working copy, pass
   `--plugin-dir /path/to/stackchan-mcp` instead of installing from the
   marketplace; Claude Code starts the gateway under
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/gateway` via the bundled `.mcp.json`.

3. Host environment setup — the Channels delivery path requires three
   host-side names to be aligned with the gateway's MCP server name
   (`stackchanmcp`, no hyphen):

   - The plugin's `.mcp.json` `mcpServers` key for this gateway must be
     `stackchanmcp`. If you previously wired the gateway under a
     different key, rename it.
   - Claude Code's `settings.local.json` `enabledMcpjsonServers`
     whitelist must include `stackchanmcp`.
   - The Channels allowlist requires a system-wide approval — Claude
     Code does not honor user-level (e.g. `~/.claude/settings.json`)
     settings for the Channels allowlist. On macOS, create or edit
     `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`
     (requires `sudo`):

     ```json
     {
       "channelsEnabled": true,
       "allowedChannelPlugins": ["stackchanmcp@kisaragi-mochi-channels"]
     }
     ```

4. Receiver side — launch Claude Code with the Channels flags:

   ```bash
   claude --channels plugin:stackchanmcp@kisaragi-mochi-channels \
          --dangerously-load-development-channels plugin:stackchanmcp@kisaragi-mochi-channels
   ```

   The `--channels` flag attaches the channel source to the gateway and
   injects `<channel source="plugin:stackchanmcp:stackchanmcp" ...>`
   blocks into the session. The
   `--dangerously-load-development-channels` flag is currently required
   alongside `--channels` because the plugin's Channels capability is
   experimental; the approved-allowlist-only path without this flag has
   been verified not to deliver notifications in current Claude Code
   versions. The flag is expected to become optional once the plugin's
   Channels capability stabilizes.

   Important — pre-plugin wiring does not receive Channels: if you
   previously wired this gateway via `~/.claude.json` `mcpServers`
   (the pre-plugin path), that wiring does not receive `<channel ...>`
   injections. Claude Code only attaches a channel source to
   plugin-loaded MCP servers. Before switching to the plugin path,
   stop any existing gateway process to release the ESP32 ownership
   lock; the plugin-loaded gateway will otherwise fail to acquire it.
   If you prefer to keep the `~/.claude.json` wiring, use
   `legacy_event` and `jsonl` instead of `channels` — both work
   without plugin loading.

5. Other hosts:

   - **Hosts with a `claude/channel`-compatible receiver**: open that
     receiver per the host's documentation. Compatibility with hosts
     other than Claude Code has not been verified in this repository.

   - **Hosts without a Channels receiver**: use the JSONL fallback (see
     below).

#### Migration from the previous `stackchan-mcp` (hyphenated) form

If you enabled Channels using the older `stackchan-mcp` server-name
form, rename to the current `stackchanmcp` form (no hyphen) in all four
places to keep the host MCP client and the gateway aligned:

- Plugin / server name: change `stackchan-mcp` to `stackchanmcp` in
  your host's `.mcp.json` `mcpServers` key, in `settings.local.json`
  `enabledMcpjsonServers` whitelist, and in the `--channels` /
  `--dangerously-load-development-channels` flag arguments.
- Channels flag form: change from `--channels server:stackchan-mcp` to
  `--channels plugin:stackchanmcp@kisaragi-mochi-channels`. The
  plugin form is the supported form now that the marketplace manifest
  is published.
- system-wide allowlist: ensure
  `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json` has
  `allowedChannelPlugins` listing
  `stackchanmcp@kisaragi-mochi-channels` (not the old `stackchan-mcp`
  form).

Without all four renames the host MCP client logs
`Channel notifications skipped: server <name> not in --channels list
for this session` and the notifications never reach the session.

#### Customizing event message wording

Each delivered event carries a short message rendered from a template.
The built-in defaults are phrased experientially — describing what the
device felt rather than naming a mechanical event — so the consuming
agent reads them as first-person narration:

| Event | Default `action` | Default `template` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `touch` / `tap` | `head_pat` | `head was tapped` |
| `touch` / `stroke` | `head_stroke` | `head was stroked for {duration_ms}ms` |

The `{duration_ms}` placeholder is substituted from the event payload;
unknown placeholders are preserved verbatim.

To override the wording, add a `messages:` block to
`~/.config/stackchan-mcp/notify.yml`. Only the event types you list are
overridden; everything else keeps the defaults above. For example, to
use a more casual phrasing:

```yaml
# ~/.config/stackchan-mcp/notify.yml
messages:
  touch:
    tap:
      action: head_pat
      template: "got a head pat"
    stroke:
      action: head_stroke
      template: "head being stroked for {duration_ms}ms"
```

Both `action` and `template` are required for each overridden subtype.
The `action` value is forwarded in the event metadata, so keep it stable
if a downstream consumer keys off it. See `notify.example.yml` for the
full annotated reference.

To restore the previous always-on event behavior:

```yaml
# ~/.config/stackchan-mcp/notify.yml
legacy_event:
  enabled: true
jsonl:
  enabled: true
  path: ~/.claude/stackchan-events.jsonl
```

## About the avatar images

`firmware/main/boards/stackchan/avatar_images.cc` is a **pure black RGB565 placeholder**. The firmware builds and runs, but the screen will display nothing.

For a personal avatar, keep PNG sources outside git and generate ignored local override files:

```bash
cd firmware
python scripts/avatar_convert/convert_avatars.py
```

By default, the converter reads PNGs from `~/.stackchan/avatar/` and writes:

- `firmware/main/boards/stackchan/avatar_images.local.cc`
- `firmware/main/boards/stackchan/avatar_images.local.h`

These local files are ignored by git. When `avatar_images.local.cc` exists, the StackChan firmware build uses it instead of the tracked black placeholder, so `git pull` will not overwrite your personal avatar.

The tracked `avatar_images.cc` / `avatar_images.h` files are public placeholder files. Maintainers who intentionally need to refresh those tracked files can pass `--tracked`, but personal avatars should use the default local output path.

If you add a local avatar after you have already built the firmware once, remove `firmware/build/` and rebuild so CMake can pick up the new local override.

Symbol list (see `avatar_images.h`):
- Expressions (6): `avatar_idle`, `avatar_happy`, `avatar_thinking`, `avatar_sad`, `avatar_surprised`, `avatar_embarrassed`
- Eyes (3): `avatar_eyes_open`, `avatar_eyes_half`, `avatar_eyes_closed`
- Mouth (5): `avatar_mouth_closed`, `avatar_mouth_half`, `avatar_mouth_open`, `avatar_mouth_e`, `avatar_mouth_u`

Expected PNG filenames under `~/.stackchan/avatar/`:

- Expressions: `idle.png`, `happy.png`, `thinking.png`, `sad.png`, `surprised.png`, `embarrassed.png`
- Eyes: `eyes_open.png`, `eyes_half.png`, `eyes_closed.png`
- Mouth: `mouth_closed.png`, `mouth_half.png`, `mouth_open.png`, `mouth_e.png`, `mouth_u.png`

Do not commit personal PNGs, generated local avatar files, photos, or other user-specific assets.

## Hardware safety notes

> ⚠️ **Y-axis (pitch) safe range — two-tier guard**

The pitch axis is guarded by two complementary tiers, both encoded in firmware and surfaced through the `set_head_angles` MCP tool description:

| Tier | Range | Enforcement | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1 — Hard clamp** | `0..+88°` | Silent clamp + `ESP_LOGW` | Prevents mechanical damage. Lower bound `0°` leaves ~1° margin above the validated mechanical end-stop on M5Stack CoreS3 + SCS0009 hardware (PR #81). Upper bound `88°` sits ~1° inside the audible sub-stall boundary observed at `pitch=89°` during the Issue #98 on-device sweep ("ji-ji-" gear strain sound). |
| **Tier 2 — Recommended operating range** | `5..+85°` | Accept + `ESP_LOGI` (soft signal) | The M5Stack-documented sweet spot for long-term servo reliability. Single requests outside this range are not hardware-damaging, but sustained operation outside `5..85°` may stress the servo over time. |

M5Stack's official documentation states:

> The movement angle of the StackChan Y-axis servo (vertical direction) is recommended to be controlled within 5 ~ 85°. Operating at extreme angles may cause **servo stall and permanent damage**.
> — https://docs.m5stack.com/en/StackChan ("Motion Angle Notice")

The `set_head_angles` MCP tool declares pitch with a fully permissive schema range — the entire `int` value range, `std::numeric_limits<int>::min()` to `std::numeric_limits<int>::max()`, corner values included; the firmware-side handler is the authoritative Tier 1 enforcement layer. Any narrower schema range would cause `McpServer::Property` to reject sufficiently-extreme out-of-range requests (e.g. `pitch=200` or `pitch=INT_MIN`) before the handler could clamp / log them, leaving the documented Tier 1 behavior unreachable for those callers — see #98. Requests below `0°` are silently raised to `0°` (with `ESP_LOGW`), requests above `88°` are silently lowered to `88°` (with `ESP_LOGW`), and requests inside `[0, 88]` but outside `[5, 85]` are accepted with an `ESP_LOGI` soft signal. Older callers that targeted `-30..+30°` continue to work without modification (the negative half clamps to `0°`).

Conversely, the **gateway-side `move_head` MCP tool** — the one LLM-driven clients see in the tool list above — declares a restrictive `pitch=5..85` / `yaw=-90..90` schema and re-enforces the same bounds in the gateway `call_tool` handler as belt-and-suspenders. This rejects out-of-recommended requests at the MCP boundary so an agent cannot accidentally trigger the bus-hang risk tracked in [#100](https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/stackchan-mcp/issues/100) from a pose-reset call like `move_head(yaw=0, pitch=0)`. Callers that need explicit access to the firmware Tier 1 hard clamp (for diagnostics, recovery sequences, or other expert use cases) should bypass `move_head` and call the firmware-side `set_head_angles` device tool directly — see [#109](https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/stackchan-mcp/issues/109).

The X-axis (yaw, `-90..+90°`) is not subject to a comparable hardware restriction — M5Stack's documentation explicitly notes "No angle restriction is required for the X-axis" — and remains usable across its full declared range.

See [#80](https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/stackchan-mcp/issues/80) for the lower-bound engineering background and [#98](https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/stackchan-mcp/issues/98) for the two-tier upper-bound widening (firmware hard clamp `30°` → `88°`, with the M5Stack-recommended `5..85°` operating range surfaced as a soft-signal tier).

## Known issues

- The servo bus may hang on large-angle abrupt reversals (e.g. +60° → -60°). A fix is in progress via Motion::update_task interpolation.
- The touch sensor (Si12T) occasionally drops tap events. Sensitivity register tuning has room to improve here.

## License

The canonical firmware build path (`firmware/scripts/release.py stackchan`) produces an **MIT-licensed end-to-end** binary. The GPL-3.0 SCServo_lib sources remain in the tree as an opt-in fallback during the migration tracked in [#79](https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/stackchan-mcp/issues/79).

| Scope | License |
|---|---|
| `gateway/`, top-level, all of `firmware/` in the **canonical build** (`release.py stackchan` appends `CONFIG_STACKCHAN_SERVO_FEETECH=y` and links the MIT [`feetech_scs_esp_idf`](https://github.com/necobit/feetech_scs_esp_idf) driver vendored under `firmware/components/feetech_scs/`) | **MIT License** (see `LICENSE`) |
| **SCServo_lib-derived files** under `firmware/main/boards/stackchan/` (SCS.{cc,h}, SCSCL.{cc,h}, SCSerial.{cc,h}, INST.h, SCServo.h) — only linked when `CONFIG_STACKCHAN_SERVO_SCSCL=y` is selected (e.g. via `sdkconfig.defaults.local`) | **GNU GPL-3.0** (see `firmware/main/boards/stackchan/SCServo_lib_LICENSE.txt`) |

The `gateway/` runs as an independent Python process and only talks to the ESP32 over the network (WebSocket), so it stays usable and derivable under the **MIT License** regardless of which servo driver the firmware-side build selects.

The gateway's `win_amd64` PyPI wheel additionally bundles `opus.dll` built from upstream Opus source by the publish workflow. That native binary ships under the **BSD 3-clause license + Xiph extension**; the notice is shipped in every distribution form as `gateway/LICENSE-THIRD-PARTY`. Non-Windows wheels and the sdist do not contain the binary — they rely on the system `libopus`. See `gateway/stackchan_mcp/_libs/SOURCES.md` for the per-release SHA256 and build provenance.

> **Note for direct `idf.py` users with a pre-existing `firmware/sdkconfig`:**
> ESP-IDF persists Kconfig choices into `firmware/sdkconfig`, and a
> change to the Kconfig `default` does not retroactively rewrite that
> file. The canonical build path enforces the MIT driver at the
> `release.py` layer (via `sdkconfig_append`), so rebuilding via
> `release.py stackchan` reliably produces the MIT default binary.
> If you bypass `release.py` and call `idf.py` directly on a workspace
> that previously selected SCSCL, you may need to run `idf.py menuconfig`
> (or delete `firmware/sdkconfig`) to pick up the new default.

> **GPL-3.0 fallback build (opt-in):**
> The original SCServo_lib sources are still shipped in the repository
> as a safety net while the migration tracked in #79 is in its
> observation period. To build against them, add
> `CONFIG_STACKCHAN_SERVO_SCSCL=y` to `firmware/sdkconfig.defaults.local`;
> `release.py` merges this in **after** `sdkconfig_append`, so it
> overrides the FEETECH default. In that configuration the firmware
> binary statically links the GPL-3.0 sources and is therefore
> **effectively distributed under GPL-3.0**. Once the observation
> period closes without regressions the GPL files are scheduled for
> removal (Phase B of #79).

### upstream

`firmware/` is taken in via git subtree from [78/xiaozhi-esp32](https://github.com/78/xiaozhi-esp32) (MIT) — specifically the [kisaragi-mochi/xiaozhi-esp32](https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/xiaozhi-esp32) fork. See [`docs/firmware-sync.md`](docs/firmware-sync.md) for the upstream sync playbook. The SCServo_lib sources under `firmware/main/boards/stackchan/` (`SCS.{cc,h}`, `SCSCL.{cc,h}`, `SCSerial.{cc,h}`, `INST.h`, `SCServo.h`) originate from [Feetech](https://www.feetechrc.com/)'s SCServo SDK and entered this repository through the same `kisaragi-mochi/xiaozhi-esp32` fork's `main/boards/stackchan/` directory at the firmware subtree merge. They remain GPL-3.0 (see `firmware/main/boards/stackchan/SCServo_lib_LICENSE.txt`).
