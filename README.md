# stackchan-mcp

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) bridge for the **M5Stack official [StackChan](https://docs.m5stack.com/ja/StackChan)** (2025 Kickstarter shipping kit), letting any LLM client drive the device.

> Born out of the [stack-chan project](https://github.com/mongonta0716/stack-chan) community (originated by Takawo-san). This repository targets the M5Stack official StackChan kit that grew out of that lineage.

From any MCP client (Claude Code / Claude Desktop / others) you can call StackChan operations such as head movement, camera capture, touch sensor reads, and avatar expression switches.

## Repository layout

This repository is a monorepo.

## Target hardware

**M5Stack official [StackChan kit](https://docs.m5stack.com/ja/StackChan)** (Kickstarter 2025 shipping version). The firmware in this repository is meant to replace the kit's [factory firmware](https://docs.m5stack.com/ja/StackChan#%E5%87%BA%E8%8D%B7%E6%99%82%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A7%E3%82%A2).

| Part | Spec |
|---|---|
| **Body** | M5Stack CoreS3 (ESP32-S3, 16MB Flash, 8MB PSRAM) |
| **Neck servos** | SCS0009 ×2 (yaw + pitch, serial bus, TX=GPIO6, RX=GPIO7) |
| **Camera** | GC0308 (DVP, 320×240) |
| **Touch** | FT6336 / Si12T |
| **Display** | ILI9342 (SPI, 320×240) |

> A self-built stack-chan (Takawo-san's original design) may also work as long as the pin assignments and I2C addresses match. Reports and PRs welcome.

## Quick start

### 1. Flash the firmware (CoreS3)

```bash
cd firmware
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/project -w /project espressif/idf:v5.5.2 \
  python ./scripts/release.py stackchan
# → releases/v2.2.6_stackchan.zip

# Flash (after USB-connecting the CoreS3)
esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port /dev/cu.usbmodem1101 -b 460800 \
  write_flash 0x0 build/merged-binary.bin
```

WiFi configuration happens after the ESP32 boots — connect from a smartphone to its setup UI (the xiaozhi-esp32 standard flow).

### Configuring the WebSocket gateway URL and auth token

The firmware reads two NVS keys for the gateway connection:

- `websocket.url` — the gateway WebSocket URL (e.g. `ws://192.168.1.100:8765/`)
- `websocket.token` — the bearer token sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`,
  matched against `STACKCHAN_TOKEN` / `BEARER_TOKEN` on the gateway side
  (leave both empty to skip authentication entirely)

There are three practical ways to provide them:

1. **Build-time defaults via Kconfig (recommended for developers)**: run
   `idf.py menuconfig` → `Component config` → `Xiaozhi Assistant`, and set:
   - `Default WebSocket gateway URL (fallback when NVS is empty)` →
     `CONFIG_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_URL` (e.g. `ws://192.168.1.100:8765/`)
   - `Default WebSocket auth token (fallback when NVS is empty)` →
     `CONFIG_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_TOKEN` (leave empty if your gateway accepts
     unauthenticated connections)

   By default these only apply when the corresponding NVS key is empty.
   For first-time flashes onto a fresh device this is exactly what you want.

2. **Write `websocket.url` / `websocket.token` directly to NVS**: this is the
   intended persistent runtime configuration path, eventually via the WiFi
   config UI. The UI fields are not implemented yet and are tracked under
   Issue #17 follow-ups.

3. **Temporary source hardcode (not recommended)**: editing
   `websocket_protocol.cc` can unblock local experiments, but keep it out of
   commits.

#### Existing devices with stale NVS — `CONFIG_FORCE_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_URL`

If you are flashing onto a device that previously ran upstream xiaozhi-esp32
firmware, NVS will already contain `websocket.url=wss://api.tenclass.net/...`
written by the upstream OTA-config path. In this case the empty-NVS fallback
in option 1 above will **not** trigger, and the device will keep trying to
talk to tenclass instead of your local gateway. There is currently no
runtime tool to clear the `websocket` NVS namespace selectively.

To work around this without erasing all of NVS (which would also drop WiFi
credentials), enable the force-override switch:

- `Force CONFIG_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_URL/TOKEN to override NVS` →
  `CONFIG_FORCE_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_URL=y`

When set, **non-empty** Kconfig URL/token values override whatever NVS holds.
Empty Kconfig values still fall through to the NVS-based behaviour, so leaving
the token Kconfig empty keeps any NVS-stored token in use. The boot log will
show `FORCE: overriding NVS websocket.url with Kconfig: NVS=... -> ...` so you
can verify the override fired. This switch is the recommended way to bring
ex-xiaozhi hardware onto a local stackchan-mcp gateway, and to lock CI/dev
images to a known gateway URL.

The switch is opt-in so end-user devices configured at runtime keep their
NVS-priority semantics.

#### Developer-local overrides — `sdkconfig.defaults.local`

For local hardware testing, do not put personal gateway URLs or tokens in the
tracked `firmware/sdkconfig.defaults`. Instead, create a gitignored local file:

```bash
cd firmware
cat > sdkconfig.defaults.local <<'EOF'
CONFIG_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_URL="ws://<your-lan-ip>:8765/"
CONFIG_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_TOKEN="<your-dev-token>"
CONFIG_FORCE_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_URL=y
EOF
```

Both `python ./scripts/release.py <board>` and plain `idf.py build` will read
this file when it exists. The file is ignored by git, so personal settings
cannot be added accidentally with `git add -A`.

### 2. Start the gateway

```bash
cd gateway
cp .env.example .env       # set STACKCHAN_TOKEN / VISION_HOST
uv sync
uv run python -m stackchan_mcp
```

### 3. Register as an MCP client (Claude Code example)

Add to `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stackchan-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run", "--directory", "/path/to/stackchan-mcp/gateway",
        "python", "-m", "stackchan_mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

See `gateway/README.md` for details.

## About the avatar images

`firmware/main/boards/stackchan/avatar_images.cc` is a **pure black RGB565 placeholder**. The firmware builds and runs, but the screen will display nothing. To show an actual avatar, regenerate `avatar_images.cc` from your own PNG images (160×120).

Symbol list (see `avatar_images.h`):
- Expressions (6): `avatar_idle`, `avatar_happy`, `avatar_thinking`, `avatar_sad`, `avatar_surprised`, `avatar_embarrassed`
- Eyes (3): `avatar_eyes_open`, `avatar_eyes_half`, `avatar_eyes_closed`
- Mouth (5): `avatar_mouth_closed`, `avatar_mouth_half`, `avatar_mouth_open`, `avatar_mouth_e`, `avatar_mouth_u`

For the PNG → RGB565 array conversion, tools like LVGL's official [Online Image Converter](https://lvgl.io/tools/imageconverter) work well.

## Known issues

- The servo bus may hang on large-angle abrupt reversals (e.g. +60° → -60°). A fix is in progress via Motion::update_task interpolation.
- The touch sensor (Si12T) occasionally drops tap events. Sensitivity register tuning has room to improve here.

## License

This repository is dual-licensed.

| Scope | License |
|---|---|
| All (`gateway/`, top-level, most of `firmware/`) | **MIT License** (see `LICENSE`) |
| **SCServo_lib-derived files** under `firmware/main/boards/stackchan/` (SCS.{cc,h}, SCSCL.{cc,h}, SCSerial.{cc,h}, INST.h, SCServo.h) | **GNU GPL-3.0** (see `firmware/main/boards/stackchan/SCServo_lib_LICENSE.txt`) |

This split exists because Feetech's SCServo SDK is distributed under GPL-3.0. The **firmware binary as a whole**, which statically links SCServo_lib, is therefore **effectively distributed under GPL-3.0**.

The `gateway/` runs as an independent Python process and only talks to the ESP32 over the network (WebSocket), so it stays usable and derivable under the **MIT License**.

### upstream

`firmware/` is taken in via git subtree from [78/xiaozhi-esp32](https://github.com/78/xiaozhi-esp32) (MIT) — specifically the [kisaragi-mochi/xiaozhi-esp32](https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/xiaozhi-esp32) fork. SCServo_lib is a firmware component ported from the official [stack-chan](https://github.com/mongonta0716/stack-chan) (Takawo-san) repository.
