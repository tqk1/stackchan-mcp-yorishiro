# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository are documented here.

The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Version tags (`vX.Y.Z`) track the **Python MCP gateway** published to PyPI
as `stackchan-mcp`. The ESP32 firmware lives in the same repository but is
built and distributed separately through `firmware/scripts/release.py` and
the upstream xiaozhi-esp32 firmware version (currently `v2.2.6`); when a
tagged gateway release also requires a coordinated firmware change, that
change is called out under a `Firmware` subsection of the release entry.

## [Unreleased]

### Firmware

- Fixed user-configured WebSocket gateway URLs (e.g.
  `ws://192.168.x.y:8765`) being silently overwritten on every boot by
  the upstream xiaozhi OTA-config response. `Ota::CheckVersion()` still
  runs (firmware-version / activation / server-time / MQTT paths are
  unchanged), but the `websocket` section of the response is no longer
  written back into NVS by default. A new Kconfig option
  `CONFIG_DISABLE_OTA_WEBSOCKET_CONFIG` (default `y`) gates this
  behavior; setting it to `n` restores the original
  xiaozhi-esp32 NVS overwrite path. The misleading comment in
  `WebsocketProtocol::OpenAudioChannelInternal()` that claimed the
  OTA-config path was already disabled has been corrected to reflect
  the actual gating. Closes
  [#110](https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/stackchan-mcp/issues/110).

- The firmware now actively positions the head at a fall-safe neutral
  pose (`yaw=0°`, `pitch=45°`) at the end of `InitializeServo()`, before
  any MCP command can arrive. Previously the head retained whatever
  angle it was left at on power-down, which could include end-stop
  positions (e.g. `pitch=0°`) that triggered the SCS0009 bus hang
  documented in
  [#100](https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/stackchan-mcp/issues/100)
  on the first user-driven motion. The new boot-time positioning uses
  the existing interpolating `WriteHeadAngles` path with a 1-second
  move duration plus a 100 ms settle delay, mirroring the `goHome()`
  pattern in `m5stack/StackChan` and the timing established in
  `mongonta0716/stackchan-arduino`. Existing pitch guards (`0..88`
  hard clamp / `5..85` recommended range) continue to apply
  unchanged. Implements
  [#99](https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/stackchan-mcp/issues/99)
  Option C and the boot-init aspect of
  [#100](https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/stackchan-mcp/issues/100)
  direction E. Refs
  [#115](https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/stackchan-mcp/issues/115).

- Improved `get_head_angles` MCP-tool diagnostics so that transient
  `ReadPos` failures can be distinguished from a genuine SCS0009 bus
  hang. The handler now retries `ReadPos` up to three times (50 ms
  inter-attempt delay) per servo ID while holding `scs_bus_mutex_`
  across the whole sequence. The success-path JSON output
  (`{"yaw":N,"pitch":N}`) is unchanged; on persistent failure the tool
  now returns
  `{"yaw":null,"pitch":null,"error":"ReadPos failed ...","servo_ok":bool,"yaw_attempts":N,"pitch_attempts":N}`
  instead of the previous sentinel `{"yaw":-144,"pitch":-194}` (the
  `-1` return from `ReadPos` run through the same
  `(pos-zero) * 5 / 16` degree-conversion math as a valid raw position,
  which was indistinguishable from a hang at the MCP layer and
  contributed to the hang judgments recorded in
  [#1](https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/stackchan-mcp/issues/1) /
  [#100](https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/stackchan-mcp/issues/100) /
  [#118](https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/stackchan-mcp/issues/118)).
  The serial-log line is also expanded to include `servo_ok`, raw
  `ReadPos` values, and attempt counts. As a further investigation
  aid, `InitializeServo()` now logs pre- and post-init `ReadPos` raw
  values and tick timestamps around the boot-init `WriteHeadAngles`
  call, making the "unintended downward drop on power-on" investigation
  ([#121](https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/stackchan-mcp/issues/121))
  data-driven via the serial log. Refs
  [#123](https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/stackchan-mcp/issues/123).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-14

### Gateway

- `listen()` now accepts optional visual/motion feedback arguments:
  `motion="face-only"` shows the `thinking` avatar during capture and
  restores `idle` at the end, while `motion="look-up"` preserves yaw,
  tilts pitch to `look_up_pitch` (validated to 5..85 degrees), shows
  `thinking`, and holds the pose on success so the caller's response
  can continue from the attentive posture. The default
  `motion="none"` preserves the existing behavior. Refs #96.

- `move_head` MCP tool now constrains `pitch` to `5..85` — the
  M5Stack-recommended operating range. Both the `inputSchema`
  (`minimum: 5`, `maximum: 85` for `pitch`; `minimum: -90`, `maximum: 90`
  for `yaw`) and the gateway `call_tool` handler enforce the bound as
  belt-and-suspenders. The tool description now references
  `set_head_angles` for callers that genuinely need the wider firmware
  hard clamp (`0..88`). This also refuses `move_head(yaw=0, pitch=0)`
  and other below-`5°` pitch requests at the MCP boundary, so an
  LLM-driven agent cannot trigger the SCS0009 servo bus hang state
  tracked in
  [#100](https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/stackchan-mcp/issues/100)
  from a default pose-reset call. See README "Y-axis (pitch) safe
  range — two-tier guard" for the gateway-side restrictive vs
  firmware-side permissive policy contrast, and the comment thread on
  [#99](https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/stackchan-mcp/issues/99) /
  [#100](https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/stackchan-mcp/issues/100)
  for the on-device reproduction (2026-05-14). Closes
  [#109](https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/stackchan-mcp/issues/109).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Phase 4 STT — gateway-side `listen(duration_ms?, engine?, language?,
  model?)` MCP tool. The gateway puts the device firmware into
  listening mode over the existing WebSocket, buffers the Opus frames
  the device streams up during the capture window, then decodes and
  transcribes them through a registered STT engine. The default
  engine is **faster-whisper** (local, MIT-licensed, runs on CPU);
  the **OpenAI Whisper API** is available as an alternative for
  setups without local compute. Install with
  `pip install stackchan-mcp[stt-faster-whisper]` (or `[stt-openai]`)
  — the `[stt]` base extra pulls in `opuslib` for inbound frame
  decoding. The framework is engine-agnostic (`stt.STTEngine` ABC +
  `stt.EngineRegistry`, symmetric to the existing `tts` package), so
  additional engines can be added in follow-up PRs without touching
  the orchestration pipeline. Configure faster-whisper with
  `STACKCHAN_FASTER_WHISPER_MODEL` (default `base`), `_DEVICE`
  (default `cpu`), and `_COMPUTE_TYPE` (default `int8`); the OpenAI
  engine reads `OPENAI_API_KEY` plus the optional
  `STACKCHAN_OPENAI_WHISPER_MODEL` (default `whisper-1`). Requires a
  paired firmware update — see the Firmware section below. Refs #91.

### Firmware

> The firmware changes below were released through the dedicated firmware
> release stream as `firmware-v1.0.0` (2026-05-10), `firmware-v1.1.0`
> (2026-05-10), `firmware-v1.2.0` (2026-05-11), and `firmware-v1.3.0`
> (paired with this gateway release — contains the server-driven
> listening trigger that the new `listen()` MCP tool depends on).
> Prebuilt binaries (`merged-binary.bin` / `xiaozhi.bin` /
> `v*_stackchan.zip`) for each tag are attached to the corresponding
> GitHub release:
> https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/stackchan-mcp/releases.
> PyPI users running pre-v1.3.0 firmware can still upgrade to
> `stackchan-mcp` 0.6.0 — only the new `listen()` MCP tool requires the
> paired firmware update; the existing `say()` and other tools continue
> to work against older firmware.

- **Server-driven listening trigger** (paired with the new
  `listen()` MCP tool above, Issue #91). The firmware's
  `Application::OnIncomingJson` handler now accepts inbound
  `{"type":"listen","state":"start"|"stop"}` messages from the
  gateway and dispatches them to `Application::StartListening` /
  `StopListening`. The wire format mirrors the existing device→gateway
  `Protocol::SendStartListening` notification in the reverse
  direction; the upstream 78/xiaozhi-esp32 protocol has no inbound
  listen type today, so this extension is additive and does not
  collide with anything upstream. The `mode` field is parsed on
  `state="start"` but currently ignored — `HandleStartListeningEvent`
  unconditionally enters `kListeningModeManualStop`, which is also
  the right behaviour for gateway-driven capture (the gateway
  controls the stop boundary explicitly). Threading `auto` /
  `realtime` mode through is a follow-up. Refs #91.
- **TTS lip-sync (state-driven)**: drive avatar mouth animation while
  the gateway is speaking. The firmware now reacts to the
  `tts.start` / `tts.stop` JSON notifications introduced in #75 (Issue
  #70 PR2) and cycles the mouth shape through `closed → half → open →
  half` on a fixed 150 ms cadence for the lifetime of each utterance,
  snapping back to `closed` at stop. Autonomous blink is paused while
  active (same Phase 2 trade-off as the existing `set_mouth_sequence`
  task: a blink ending would otherwise restore the full-face image
  and overwrite the mouth overlay) and restored at stop based on
  `blink_desired_` so a `set_blink` issued mid-playback is honoured.
  Coexists with user-issued `set_mouth` / `set_mouth_sequence` calls
  by yielding the current frame when `mouth_seq_active_` is true; the
  user-issued sequence wins until it completes, then lip-sync resumes
  on the next tick. Wired through a new no-op `Board::OnTtsStart` /
  `OnTtsStop` hook so non-stackchan boards are unaffected. The (B)
  audio-envelope-driven follow-up proposed in the issue will be
  tracked separately. Closes #76. Refs #70, #75.
- **Default servo driver switched to MIT FeetechScs** (Phase A of the
  GPL → MIT firmware migration tracked in #79). The opt-in MIT driver
  added in #82 is now the build default for the canonical build path
  (`firmware/scripts/release.py stackchan`), which now appends
  `CONFIG_STACKCHAN_SERVO_FEETECH=y` to the per-board `sdkconfig` so
  the selection is enforced regardless of any pre-existing
  `firmware/sdkconfig` left in the workspace. Builds produced this way
  exclude the GPL-3.0 SCServo_lib sources from the linked binary —
  i.e. the firmware binary is MIT-licensed end-to-end. Equivalence
  with SCSCL was validated on M5Stack CoreS3 + SCS0009 x2 in #82.

  **Migration note for users with an existing `firmware/sdkconfig`:**
  ESP-IDF persists Kconfig choices into `firmware/sdkconfig`, and a
  Kconfig `default` change does not retroactively rewrite that file.
  This release works around that by enforcing the choice at the
  `release.py` layer (`sdkconfig_append`); rebuilding via
  `release.py stackchan` produces an MIT default binary even on a
  workspace that previously selected SCSCL. If you build by directly
  invoking `idf.py` instead and have an existing `sdkconfig`, you may
  need to run `idf.py menuconfig` (or delete `firmware/sdkconfig`) to
  pick up the new default.

  **Opting back into the GPL fallback:** the GPL-3.0 SCServo_lib
  sources remain in-tree. To build against them, add
  `CONFIG_STACKCHAN_SERVO_SCSCL=y` to `firmware/sdkconfig.defaults.local`
  (which `release.py` merges in *after* `sdkconfig_append`, so it wins
  over the FEETECH default).

  Phase B (removal of the SCServo_lib sources, fully MIT-only
  firmware) is gated on a multi-week observation period in #79 closing
  without regressions. Please open an issue referencing #79 if you
  observe any regression after rebuilding so the migration can be held
  or rolled back. Refs #79.
- `firmware/scripts/release.py` no longer **skips** the build when
  `releases/v{PROJECT_VER}_{board}.zip` already exists. `PROJECT_VER`
  is pinned to the upstream xiaozhi-esp32 firmware version
  (currently `2.2.6`) and is not bumped per stackchan-mcp change, so
  the previous skip behaviour silently let an old artifact survive a
  rebuild invocation — including across license-sensitive
  configuration changes such as the FEETECH/SCSCL servo driver swap
  above. Existing `releases/v2.2.6_<board>.zip` files are now
  automatically replaced by a fresh build (`zip_bin` already unlinks
  before writing). Manual `rm -rf firmware/releases/v2.2.6_*.zip`
  before invoking `release.py` is no longer required. Refs #79.
- Add opt-in MIT-licensed servo driver alternative
  (`firmware/components/feetech_scs/`, vendored from
  [necobit/feetech_scs_esp_idf](https://github.com/necobit/feetech_scs_esp_idf)
  at commit `38a91984`). Build with Kconfig
  `CONFIG_STACKCHAN_SERVO_FEETECH=y` to exclude the GPL-3.0 SCServo_lib
  sources and produce a fully MIT-licensed firmware binary. (Promoted
  to default in the entry above.) Refs #79.
- **Hardware safety**: clamp `set_head_angles` pitch parameter to a
  hardware-safe sub-range (`0..+30°`) to prevent driving the SCS0009 servo
  into its mechanical end-stop. M5Stack docs explicitly warn that operating
  the Y-axis outside the recommended range may cause servo stall and
  permanent damage; on the CoreS3 + SCS0009 hardware this firmware targets,
  the mechanical end-stop sits at approximately `pitch=-1°` (validated on
  a real unit during #79). The MCP property declaration keeps the
  `-30..+30°` numerical range for backward compatibility, but the handler
  silently raises sub-zero requests with an `ESP_LOGW` warning. README
  gains a new "Hardware safety notes" section. Refs #80.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- Phase 4 TTS — gateway-side `say(text, voice?, speaker_id?,
  reference_audio?)` MCP tool. The gateway synthesises speech via a
  registered TTS engine, encodes the result to Opus (16 kHz mono,
  60 ms frames), and pushes the frames to the device over the existing
  WebSocket binary channel. **No firmware changes are required**: the
  device's WebSocket protocol already accepts Opus payloads as binary
  frames. The default engine is **VOICEVOX**, which runs as a separate
  HTTP service (the official `voicevox/voicevox_engine` Docker image is
  the recommended setup), so VOICEVOX's LGPL-3.0 license stays scoped
  to the engine process and does not affect the gateway. Install with
  `pip install stackchan-mcp[tts]` (adds `httpx` and `opuslib`); the
  `[tts-voicevox]` extra is provided as an intent-declaring alias.
  Configure with `STACKCHAN_VOICEVOX_URL` (default
  `http://127.0.0.1:50021`) and `STACKCHAN_VOICEVOX_DEFAULT_SPEAKER`
  (default `3`, Zundamon normal). The framework is engine-agnostic
  (`tts.TTSEngine` ABC + `tts.EngineRegistry`), so additional engines —
  e.g. Irodori-TTS for zero-shot voice cloning — can be added in
  follow-up PRs without touching the orchestration pipeline. Refs #70.
- New MCP tools to drive the 12× WS2812C RGB LEDs on the StackChan
  base: `set_led(index, r, g, b)`, `set_all_leds(r, g, b)`,
  `set_leds(colors)` (batch, single I2C burst for animations), and
  `clear_leds()`. The strip is wired to the PY32L020 IO expander on
  expander pin 13 — not an ESP32 GPIO — so the firmware extends the
  existing `Py32IoExpander` helper with `SetDriveMode`, `SetLedCount`,
  `SetLedColor` (RGB888 → RGB565 packing), `SetLedData` (burst write),
  and `RefreshLeds` (RMW preserves the count nibble alongside the
  bit-6 latch trigger), matching the M5 BSP's
  `PY32IOExpander_Class.cpp`. `InitializeIOExpander` configures pin 13
  as push-pull output with pull-up, sets the LED count to 12, waits
  the M5-prescribed 200 ms before the first refresh, then clears the
  strip. The on-device tools (`self.led.set_color`, `self.led.set_all`,
  `self.led.set_many`, `self.led.clear`) all latch implicitly so each
  call is WYSIWYG; the gateway re-packs the Python `colors` list as a
  JSON string for `set_many` since the device-side MCP property layer
  has only scalar types. `set_many` validates every entry (including
  a `cJSON_IsNumber` guard so non-number elements like `"255"` or
  `null` no longer silently coerce to 0) before any I2C write, so
  malformed input cannot leave the strip in a partially-mutated
  state. All four tools no-op cleanly with an `available=false`
  reply when the PY32 init failed, so a flaky expander does not
  cascade into errors.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-09

### Firmware

- Fixed: WebSocket auto-reconnect now triggers on any post-handshake
  server- or network-initiated disconnect — gateway crashes, TLS-layer
  resets, and gateway configurations that tear the WebSocket session
  down after the handshake. Previously the firmware logged the
  disconnect, returned to `idle`, and stayed there until a hard reset
  or user interaction; the reconnect path introduced in PR #35 was
  effectively suppressed for these cases. Real-device tracing (CoreS3,
  TLS-terminated gateway) showed that the original global atomic
  `auto_reconnect_enabled_` flag was being cleared by an *unrelated*
  user-initiated path (`HandleToggleChatEvent → CloseAudioChannel`,
  reachable via a brief tap on the FT6336 LCD touch panel while the
  device was in `listening`) running on the main task between handshake
  completion and the `OnDisconnected` lambda firing on the WS task —
  silently disarming the reconnect even when the underlying close was
  not user-initiated. The fix replaces the global atomic flag with a
  per-socket `shared_ptr<std::atomic<bool>>` (`notify_disconnect`)
  whose lifetime is tied to the websocket itself: each candidate in
  `OpenAudioChannelInternal()` creates its own token, `ParseServerHello`
  flips it to `true` the moment the server hello arrives (before
  setting the wait bit, so a near-simultaneous close still observes an
  armed flag), and any path that intentionally tears down *that
  specific* socket (`CloseAudioChannel`, the destructive prologue of
  `OpenAudioChannelInternal`, or the destructor) flips it back to
  `false` synchronously before invoking `websocket_.reset()`. The
  lambda's early-return guard short-circuits if and only if the
  firmware itself wanted the close, while every server- or
  network-initiated disconnect falls through to `ScheduleReconnect()`.
  A separate `intentional_close_` atomic re-checks intent on the main
  task right before the deferred reconnect job runs, so a reconnect
  enqueued via `Application::Schedule()` before `CloseAudioChannel()`
  ran cannot reopen the channel against the user's intent (the
  `esp_timer_stop()` call alone cannot cancel work the timer has
  already re-posted). The `esp_timer_create` and `esp_timer_start_once`
  return values are now inspected and logged on failure, and
  `esp_timer_stop()` warnings other than `ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` are
  surfaced. ([#61])

[#61]: https://github.com/kisaragi-mochi/stackchan-mcp/issues/61

### Added

- New `set_mouth_sequence` MCP tool: queue a list of
  `{shape, duration_ms}` steps and play it on the device locally so a
  TTS-driven caller can ship one MCP call per utterance instead of N
  back-to-back `set_mouth` calls (which suffer per-step WebSocket RTT
  jitter). The gateway exposes a proper array schema with `shape`
  constrained to `closed | half | open | e | u` and `duration_ms` to
  10..10000 ms; sequences are 1..256 steps. Because the ESP32 MCP
  Property type system only supports string/integer/boolean, the
  gateway serialises `steps` to a JSON string under `steps_json` and
  the firmware decodes it via cJSON; this is an internal wire detail
  hidden from MCP clients. Validation is atomic — if any step is
  malformed the whole call is rejected and nothing is queued (no
  half-played sequences). Calling `set_mouth`, `set_avatar`, or
  `set_mouth_sequence` again interrupts the in-flight sequence and
  also clears any pending-but-not-yet-started sequence, so a
  `set_mouth("closed")` issued in the brief window between
  `set_mouth_sequence` returning and the playback task waking up
  still wins. Each preempt also bumps a generation token that the
  playback task re-checks before every frame draw, eliminating the
  small race where a stale mouth frame could otherwise be drawn
  after a newer command had already returned to the caller. A
  separate `cancel_mouth_sequence` tool is intentionally not added —
  `set_mouth("closed")` doubles as the cancellation path, keeping
  the MCP surface minimal. Autonomous blink is paused during
  playback because the blink state machine ends by restoring the
  last full-face image, which would otherwise overwrite the active
  mouth overlay; blink is resumed when the sequence finishes (or is
  interrupted) by reading the user's most recent `set_blink` intent
  rather than a snapshot taken at sequence start, so a `set_blink`
  call issued mid-sequence is honoured (such a call returns `ok`
  with `deferred: true` and applies the moment the sequence ends).
  Note: like `set_mouth`, the final mouth shape can also be replaced
  by the resting face once an autonomous blink fires after the
  sequence — this is the same Phase 2 trade-off (the blink state
  machine ends by repainting the full face). Callers that need a
  non-closed final shape to persist visually should disable blink
  with `set_blink(false)` before the sequence; a follow-up to make
  blink composable with mouth overlays is tracked separately. The final shape is held after the sequence finishes
  so callers can compose with future expression-style use cases;
  append a `{"shape": "closed", "duration_ms": ...}` step if you want
  the mouth to close at the end. Designed to compose with a future
  TTS pipeline (caller pre-computes shapes from phonemes / aeneas
  alignment / mora timing and ships the whole sequence in one call).
  Requires a firmware update. ([#5])
- The on-device WiFi configuration UI now also exposes a **Fallback
  Gateway URL** field and a **Gateway Token** field on the **Advanced**
  tab, alongside the existing WebSocket Gateway URL field. The values
  are persisted to the `websocket` NVS namespace as
  `websocket.fallback_url` and `websocket.token` — the same keys the
  firmware connection logic reads on the next boot. End users running a
  pre-built firmware can now configure the full primary + fallback +
  bearer-token gateway profile from `http://192.168.4.1` without
  rebuilding from source. Token handling is hardened against the
  unauthenticated WiFi config AP: the token value is never returned by
  the configuration GET endpoint (only an "is set" boolean), is
  rendered as a password input, and is redacted from the per-submit
  save log. Submitting the form with the token field left blank keeps
  the existing token; typing a new value updates it; ❌ writes an empty
  string to NVS so the firmware falls back to the build-time
  `CONFIG_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET_TOKEN` on the next boot — which disables
  auth on stock builds where no Kconfig default is set, but reverts to
  the bundled default on builds that ship one. ([#43])

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- `stackchan-mcp` CLI now supports `--help` / `-h` and `--version` /
  `-V` flags. `--help` prints usage and the supported environment
  variables (`STACKCHAN_TOKEN`, `VISION_URL`, `VISION_HOST`,
  `VISION_TOKEN`, `HOST`, `WS_PORT`, `CAPTURE_PORT`) plus pointers to
  the in-tree READMEs, and exits without binding any ports.
  `--version` prints the installed package version. End users running
  `pipx install stackchan-mcp` can now confirm the install and check
  basic usage without starting a server. ([#52], [#53])
- `stackchan-mcp --check` runs a non-destructive preflight and exits
  without entering the stdio MCP loop. It loads `.env`, reports
  configuration with secrets redacted (`STACKCHAN_TOKEN`, `VISION_URL`
  derived from `VISION_HOST` when not set explicitly, `VISION_TOKEN`),
  probes the WebSocket and capture ports (`HOST:WS_PORT`,
  `HOST:CAPTURE_PORT`) via a non-blocking `bind()`, and best-effort
  reports the holding process via `lsof` when a port is in use. Exit
  status is `0` if ready, non-zero with an issue count when at least
  one blocking problem is detected. Live device connectivity probing
  is intentionally out of scope. ([#54])

### Changed

- `stackchan_mcp.__version__` is now resolved from installed package
  metadata (`importlib.metadata.version("stackchan-mcp")`) instead of
  a hard-coded literal, so the value tracks `gateway/pyproject.toml`
  automatically across releases.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- `set_avatar` now accepts `"off"` as a face value. When called with
  `"off"`, the avatar layer is hidden and autonomous blinking is
  disabled so the underlying xiaozhi-esp32 screens (WiFi config UI,
  OTA, settings) become visible on the LCD without erasing NVS.
  Calling `set_avatar` with any other face brings the avatar back and
  restores the previous blink state automatically. ([#3])
- The on-device WiFi configuration UI now exposes a **WebSocket
  Gateway URL** field on the **Advanced** tab. The value is persisted
  to the `websocket` NVS namespace (`websocket.url`), which is the
  same key the firmware connection logic reads on the next boot. End
  users running a pre-built firmware can now point a fresh device at
  their stackchan-mcp gateway from `http://192.168.4.1` without
  rebuilding from source. The upstream `78/esp-wifi-connect` managed
  component is kept in `firmware/components/78__esp-wifi-connect/` as
  a project-level component override so the patch is explicit and
  versioned in this repository. ([#25])

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-07

Initial PyPI release of the gateway. End users can now install the MCP
server without cloning the monorepo:

```bash
pipx install stackchan-mcp
# or
uv tool install stackchan-mcp
```

### Added

- Publish the gateway to PyPI as `stackchan-mcp`. A single
  `stackchan-mcp` console script starts the gateway. ([#11], [#46])
- Tag-driven publish workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) using
  PyPI Trusted Publishing. The workflow refuses to publish unless the
  tag commit is on `origin/main`, the tag has a `v` prefix and matches
  `gateway/pyproject.toml` after PEP 440 normalization, the version is
  not a PEP 440 local version, and `uv run ruff check .` plus
  `uv run pytest` succeed inside `gateway/`. ([#46])
- `workflow_dispatch` dry-run support for `publish.yml` so maintainers
  can verify lint, test, and build without cutting a tag; the publish
  job is gated on `push` so manual runs cannot release. ([#47])
- Bundle the MIT `LICENSE` in both the published wheel and sdist via
  `license-files = ["LICENSE"]` (PEP 639). ([#46])

### Changed

- Split the gateway entry point into `stackchan_mcp.cli:main` so that
  `import stackchan_mcp` is side-effect-free (no `load_dotenv()` or
  `logging.basicConfig()` at import time). `python -m stackchan_mcp`
  continues to work through a thin re-export in `__main__.py`. ([#46])

### Fixed

- Pin `astral-sh/setup-uv` to a full `vX.Y.Z` tag (`v8.1.0`) in the
  publish workflow. Starting with v8 the upstream ships immutable
  releases only and does not maintain a moving `@v8` major-version
  alias, so the previous floating pin no longer resolved. ([#47])
